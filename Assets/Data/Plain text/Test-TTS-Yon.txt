Once upon a time, there was a little mermaid named Ariel who lived under the sea with her father King Triton and her sisters. She loved to explore the ocean and collect human things that she found on the seafloor. She had a secret cave where she kept all her treasures, such as forks, mirrors, books, and a statue of a handsome prince.
One day, she saw a big ship sailing on the surface of the water. She was curious and swam closer to take a look. She saw many people on board, dancing and singing. She also saw the prince that she had a statue of. He was even more handsome in real life. She fell in love with him at first sight.
