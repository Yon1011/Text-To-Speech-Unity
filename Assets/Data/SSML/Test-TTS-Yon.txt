This is the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, a boy who traded his cow for some magic beans. He planted the beans and they grew into a giant beanstalk. He climbed up the beanstalk and found a castle in the sky. There lived a giant who had a hen that laid golden eggs and a harp that played by itself. Jack stole the hen and the harp and ran away. The giant chased him down the beanstalk, but Jack chopped it down with an axe. The giant fell to his death and Jack became rich and happy.
